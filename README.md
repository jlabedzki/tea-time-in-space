Tea Time In Space is a chrome extension that overrides chrome's newtab page. It displays an interesting fact of the day, the astronomy photo of the day, realtime location of the ISS on an interactive map, and a list of astronauts currently in space with extra information about each astronaut.

This project's main purpose was to serve as my final project for Harvard's [CS50x](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home) course. It was inspired by my love for space and I hope that this extension can extend (pun fully intended) that interest to other people.

# Credit

This project was bootstrapped with [chrome-extension-boilerplate-react](https://github.com/lxieyang/chrome-extension-boilerplate-react) and it would not be possible without the following APIs:

- [Astronomy Photo of the Day](https://api.nasa.gov/)
- [Current location of the ISS](http://open-notify.org/Open-Notify-API/ISS-Location-Now/)
- [Astronaut information](https://ll.thespacedevs.com/docs/)

Thank you to all of the contributors and maintainers.
